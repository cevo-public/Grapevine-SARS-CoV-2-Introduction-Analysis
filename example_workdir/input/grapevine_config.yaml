max_sampling_fraction: 0.05  # Maximum proportion of confirmed cases to sub-sample to, e.g. 0.005 takes at most X = (0.005 * confirmed cases) Swiss sequences from each week. -1 will include all sequences, regardless of confirmed case numbers.
subsample_by_canton: false  # If sub-sampling enabled, 'true' will subsample within switzerland proportional to confirmed cases at the cantonal level

which_trees: '\.*' # R regex to match in the gisaid_sequence 'pangolin_lineage' field. E.g. '\.*' for all lineages, or for lineage B.1.617 and its descendents, use 'B\\.1\\.617(\\.|).*'"
pick_chains_under_other_criteria: false  # If true, will also report transmission chains under different maximum total exports, maximum consecutive exports criteria.
n_trees: -1  # will generate a tree for all lineages unless a positive integer, then will take only N first lineages; for testing purposes
smooth_conf_cases: false  # If true smooths confirmed cases across 3 week window prior to downsampling genome sequences.

Currently "EPI_ISL_406798|2019-12-26" is hardcoded as the outgroup in main.sh but strains listed here will still be included in each alignment.
