Time:    Wed Mar  3 21:29:25 2021
Kernel:  AVX+FMA - 1 threads (2 CPU cores detected)

HINT: Use -nt option to specify number of threads because your CPU has 2 cores!
HINT: -nt AUTO will automatically determine the best number of threads to use.

TREE 1
*PROCESSING:
Reading the tree ... 
Collapse 0 (over 4) internal branches having branch length <= 1.67e-05
 (settable via option -l)
Parameter to adjust variances was set to 0.000334 (settable via option -b)
Calculating the outlier nodes with Zscore threshold 3 (setable via option -e)...
Minimum branch length of time scaled tree was set to 0 (settable
 via option -u and -U)
Estimating the root position on the branch defined by given outgroups ...
Computing confidence intervals using sequence length 29903 and a lognormal
 relaxed clock with mean 1, standard deviation 0.4 (settable via option -q)
*WARNINGS:
- The estimated rate reaches the given lower bound. To change the lower bound, use option -t.
*RESULTS:
- There is not any outlier date.
